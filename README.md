# Disorder-Specific Symptom-Linked rsEEG FC Dimension

## **Overview**

We present an analytical framework that identifies disorder-specific symptom-linked functional connectivity (FC) dimensions in psychiatric disorders. The framework consists of two steps: 1) the contrastive learning step that distills disorder-specific variability from the overall heterogeneity in psychiatric patients, and 2) the sparse canonical correlation analysis that identifies association between multivariate dimensions of neuroimaging data (FC) and symptom profiles. Collectively, these steps endow the framework with unique capability for identifying brain-clinical dimensions in psychiatric disorders featuring disorder-specific information and symptom profiles in a multivariate basis. 

As we have demonstrated its application in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we also propose its generalizability to other psychiatric disorders and FC based on other modalities (e.g. fMRI). For more details, please see the accompanying paper:"Symptom dimensions of resting-state electroencephalographic functional connectivity in autism", **_Nature Mental Health_** (2024).
