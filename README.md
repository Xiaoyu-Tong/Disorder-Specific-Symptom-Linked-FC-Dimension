# Disorder-Specific Symptom-Linked rsEEG FC Dimension

We present an analytical framework that identifies disorder-specific symptom-linked functional connectivity (FC) dimensions in psychiatric disorders. The framework consists of two steps: 1) the contrastive learning that distills disorder-specific variability from the overall heterogeneity in psychiatric patients, and 2) the (sparse) canonical correlation analysis that identifies association between multivariate dimensions of neuroimaging data (FC) and symptom profiles. 

As we have demonstrated its application in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we also propose its generalizability to other psychiatric disorders and FC based on other modalities (e.g. fMRI). For more details, please see the accompanying paper:"Symptom Dimensions of Resting-State Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity in Autism", **_Nature Mental Health_** (2023).
